Vehicle Rental System – Project Description
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

Project Title: Vehicle Rental System
Tech Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)

2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Currently, most small vehicle rental services manage bookings manually or through phone calls.
This leads to:

No real-time vehicle availability information

Booking conflicts and human errors

Difficulty in managing customer and vehicle records

Customers must visit or call the rental office to check availability and confirm bookings.

3. PROPOSED SOLUTION

Users can view available vehicles online

Users can book vehicles for a selected date and duration

Admin and Fleet Manager can manage vehicles and bookings

The system updates vehicle availability in real-time

All data is stored securely in a centralized database
